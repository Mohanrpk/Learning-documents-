# Operators

# Arithmentic Operators


a = 10
b = 5   

print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division    

# Comparison Operators

print(a == b)  # Equal to
print(a != b)  # Not equal to
print(a > b)   # Greater than
print(a < b)   # Less than

# Logical Operators
print(a > 0 and b > 0)  # Logical AND
print(a > 0 or b < 0)   # Logical OR
print(not (a > b))  # Logical NOT

If Else Condition :

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age > 18:
    print("You are a Adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a Teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a Child.")


# For Loops 
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# While loop

count = 1
while count <= 3:
    print("Learning while loop", count)
    count += 1

Remember Loops as :
For loop: like following a checklist — “Do task for each item on the list.”

While loop: like “keep doing this until the condition changes” — e.g., “Keep studying until you pass the test.”



#  Nested loop — a loop inside another loop:

for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)


# Guess the number game
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
attepts = 0

print ("Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!")

while True:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    attepts += 1
    
    if guess < number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    elif guess > number:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
    else:
        print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {number} in {attepts} attempts.")
        break
